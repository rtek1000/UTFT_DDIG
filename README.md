# UTFT_DDIG
UTFT DDIG was made to improve the display response time of seven-segment numbers, the accepted value is between 0-9 and 10-15 (A-F)

This library (UTFT_DDIG) extends the UTFT_DLB library, which in turn extends the UTFT library.

So both libraries are needed.

UTFT DDIG was made to improve the display response time of seven-segment numbers, the accepted value is between 0-9 and 10-15 (A-F)

You can control:

- Position
- Width
- Height
- Thickness (Minimum segment thickness: 2 px)
- Color

Test: [UTFT_DDIG speed test example (Arduino Mega + SSD1963 with 7 inch TFT) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amKvzLVV9GM)
- (The red number originates in the font made for the UTFT library, the green color numbers are generated in the library code UTFT_DDIG)
